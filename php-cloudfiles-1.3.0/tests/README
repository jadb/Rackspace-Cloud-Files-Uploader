There are two options for running the test suite.

1) Command-line: Modify "cloudfiles_ini.php" and put in your valid
   Mosso Username and API Access Key.  Then invoke the shell wrapper
   script "run_tests.sh" from this directory.

2) Web script: Set up an Apache instance/vhost to serve this directory
   as its DocumentRoot.  When "index.php" is called, you need to enter
   a valid Mosso Username and API Access Key.

   NOTE: Modify your Apache instance to serve the "index.php" file.  One way is
   to add a file similar to the one below to your <tt>/etc/apache2/conf.d</tt>
   directory and restart Apache.  You could then invoke the page by pointing
   your browser to
   <a href="http://localhost/php-cloudfiles">http://localhost/php-cloudfiles</a>.

    <VirtualHost *>
      Alias /php-cloudfiles /home/ej/php-cloudfiles/tests

      DocumentRoot /home/ej/php-cloudfiles/tests
      <Directory /home/ej/php-cloudfiles/tests>
        Options Indexes
        AllowOverride None
      </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

Troubleshooting:  If the tests fail for some reason, the Cloud Files account
will be let in an inconsistent state with respect to the parital test run.
Correct any errors and re-run the tests two times to re-sync the account's
test data with a full start-to-finish test run.  Rinse and repeat.
